# Gesture Tracking Robotic Arm



This repository details on the code and hardware on how to code a gesture tracking robotic arm glove using flex sensors and a 4 DOF robotic arm.



#### General Guidance:

* To properly make this you would need a glove to connect the flex sensors to. I recommend a glove that is ever so slightly stretchy enough for you to fit your fingers in but not very stretchy because that can change the shape of the glove that the flex sensors are attached to. 
* You will need a way to attach the flex sensors to the glove. I find the best method to be zip ties. Do not put the zip ties on too tightly or you won't be able to fit your fingers through the glove.
